          Whenever you need something that you donâ€™t own yet. Simply request it
          from your neighbours and borrow it for the time needed!

          Start by making your items available to the community!

        <h5 class="black">
          Did you know that 80% of our owned items is only used once per month.
          Living in clutter of items we do not use can be stressful. Instead of
          owning everything, why not own the essentials and borrow the rest. The
          goal of this platform is to make all the available items visible to
          your members so they can be requested at any time!
        </h5>
